## DSA_IN_A_SHELL 🎉

### Introduction 🌟

DSA_IN_DSA_IN_A_SHELL is a university project developed by Nina, Johannes Leon, and Noah as part of a Python module 📚.
This innovative project combines fundamental data structures and algorithms with elements of Das Schwarze Auge (DSA)
🧙‍♂️, a renowned German tabletop role-playing game 🎲. By integrating these two worlds, the project aims to create an
engaging and interactive experience that showcases both the technical aspects of programming and the imaginative
storytelling of DSA 🌐. The project allows users to explore data structures and algorithms in a fantasy setting, making
learning more enjoyable and interactive 🎮.

### What is DSA? 🤔

Das Schwarze Auge is a classic Pen-&-Paper-Rollenspiel 📝, first introduced by Ulrich Kiesow, Werner Fuchs, and Hans
Joachim Alpers in 1984 📆. It is set in the rich fantasy world of Aventurien 🌟, a continent filled with diverse climates,
cultures, and magical creatures 🌐. Aventurien is home to various species, including humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and
dragons, each with their own magical abilities and cultural backgrounds 🧝‍♀️. The game is known for its detailed
history, complex magic system, and the Zwölfgötterglaube, a pantheon of twelve gods that shape the world's mythology 🌟.
Players immerse themselves in this world, using their imagination to create unique stories and adventures 📚. The game's
combat system involves strategic attacks and parades, while magic is based on individually defined spells that are
managed through astral energy ⚔️.
